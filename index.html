      </div>

      <div class="pure-u-1-2">
        <p>Stucco addresses two fundamental needs in cyber attack discovery and situational understanding: (1) putting security events in context, and (2) understanding threats as they relate to a cyber security analyst’s environment. First, using today’s technologies it is difficult for cyber security analysts to put an event into context. Security event data, such as intrusion detection system alerts, provide a starting point for analysis but are information impoverished. Analysts must manually gather and synthesize relevant data to add context to events. Further, these sources are almost all from within an enterprise, ignoring the vast amounts of data available external to the enterprise that could be used to provide context to events.. Second, it is difficult to perceive threats relevant to an analysts’ network. Threat views are too high- or low- level to glean much about current and trending threats. In addition, the data gathering and synthesizing to determine which threats are important for resource allocation and policy decisions is a manual process. There is a wealth of available data that could be used to provide context for security events and to facilitate threat awareness relevant to an analyst’s environment, but this data is not currently systematically collected or integrated into cyber security systems.</p>

      <div class="pure-u-1-2">
        <p>Cyber security analysts need information to gain situational understanding – not more data that lacks context. Our focus is not to simply collect more data for indexing or clustering documents. Instead, our focus is to organize domain concepts that match the way analysts think. The goal of Stucco is to collect data sources not typically integrated into security systems and extract as well as organize domain concepts into a knowledge graph to accelerate situational understanding. Stucco will leverage endogenous and exogenous data sources to provide context to cyber security events in addition to a personalized threat view. </p>
        <p>By organizing data into a knowledge graph, security analysts will be able to rapidly search for domain concepts, speeding up access to the information needed for decision-making. Additionally, the information returned will only be that which is pertinent to their search. This approach ensures that only the minimal set of relevant information is provided to the analyst, ensuring they aren’t overwhelmed by additional data. Our approach enables analysts to more quickly identify events that can be discarded as false positives and to perform more thorough analysis with the relevant context to make decisions.</p>
