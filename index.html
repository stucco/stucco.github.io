    <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
    <div class="lead">Stucco addresses a fundamental problem in cyber security: quickly putting security events in context.</div>
    <section>
        <p>Security event data, such as intrusion detection system alerts, provide a starting point for analysis, but are information impoverished. To provide context, analysts must manually gather and synthesize relevant data from myriad sources within their enterprise and external to it. Analysts search system logs, network flows, and firewall data; they search IP blacklists and reputation lists, software vulnerability information, malware and threat data, OS and application vendor blogs, and news sites. All of these sources are manually searched for data relevant to the event being investigated. Relevant results must then be brought together and synthesized to put the event in context and make decisions about its importance and impact.</p>

        <p>This is a manual, tedious process, but the results of this process are required to know how to react to events. Stucco is a cyber intelligence platform to help automate this process and provide relevant information to analysts quickly and easily. Stucco collects data not typically integrated into security systems, extracts domain concepts and relationships, and integrates that information into a <strong>cyber security knowledge graph</strong> to accelerate decision making.</p>

        <p>By organizing data into a knowledge graph, security analysts will be able to rapidly search for domain concepts, speeding up access to the information needed for decision-making. The information returned will only be that which is pertinent to their search. Our approach enables analysts to more quickly identify events that can be discarded as false positives and to perform more thorough analysis with the relevant context to make decisions.</p>

    <h3 id="started">Getting Started</h3>

    <h4>Demonstration Site</h4>
    <p>We have a demonstration site now available:  <a href="http://stucco.stanford.edu/">http://stucco.stanford.edu/</a>
    </p>

    <h4>Run a pre-configured demo VM</h4>
    <p>To run a virtual machine locally, you just need to install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a>, <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html">Vagrant</a>. These instructions will pull the VM image from <a href="https://atlas.hashicorp.com/stucco">atlas.hashicorp.com/stucco</a>.
    Create a `Vagrantfile` with the following contents:
      <pre>
Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|
  config.vm.box = "stucco/demo"
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 8000, host: 8000
  config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/vagrant", disabled: true
end</pre>
    Then, open up a terminal and enter the following:
      <pre>
vagrant up</pre>
    Then you can open a web browser to <a href="http://localhost:8000/help">http://localhost:8000/help</a> and start looking at the data that has been pre-loaded into the VM. </p>

    <h4>Build your own VM</h4>
    <p>To get started with a demonstration environment, you will need a Linux or Mac OS X host with at least 16GB of memory. We have tested on Mac OS X 10.9, Ubuntu 12.04, and CentOS 6. Install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a>, <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html">Vagrant</a>, and <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html">Ansible</a> (<a href="http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html#control-machine-requirements">Ansible requires Python 2.6</a>). Then, open up a terminal and enter the following:
      <pre>
git clone https://github.com/stucco/dev-setup.git stucco
cd stucco
vagrant up</pre>
      Then you can open a web browser to <a href="http://10.10.10.100:8000/help">http://10.10.10.100:8000/help</a> and start looking at the data being collected (it takes a while to collect all of the data). For more detailed instructions, see the <a href="https://github.com/stucco/dev-setup/blob/master/README.md">dev-setup Readme</a>.
    </p>
    <p>If you run into any issues getting the demonstration working, please <a href="https://github.com/stucco/dev-setup/issues/new">submit an issue</a>.
    </p>

    <h3 id="code">Source Code</h3>
    <section>
      <p>This project is open-source, under <a href="https://github.com/stucco/stucco.github.io/blob/master/LICENSE.md">an MIT license</a>. All source code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/stucco/">https://github.com/stucco/</a>.
      </p>
      <p>The main components of the system are:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/stucco/collectors">Collectors</a>: Suite of data collectors for scheduling and gathering structured and unstructured documents.</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/stucco/rt">RT</a>: Real-time processing engine that extracts domain concepts from documents and inserts those concepts into a knowledge graph.</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/stucco/document-service">Document Service</a>: Storage service for text documents and metadata over an HTTP API. This is the repository for unprocessed documents.</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/stucco/ui">UI</a>: Web application and API for interacting with the Stucco knowledge graph.</li>
        </ul>
        There are <a href="https://github.com/stucco?query=ansible">Ansible roles</a> to facilitate installing each of these components. Stucco relies on <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a> to pass data into the system, and <a href="http://thinkaurelius.github.io/titan/">Titan</a> - a distributed graph database - to store the knowledge graph.
      </p>
      <p>Stucco is still a work in progress and not yet fully documented, but we do have some <a href="https://github.com/stucco/docs">Documentation</a>, although some may be out of date; we are in the progress of cleaning things up.
